# <img src="Iot.png" height="70" width="120">Getting Started with Internet of Things (IoT)
The internet of things offers an unparalleled opportunity to ignite profound business transformation across every
industry. We are moving towards a new computing paradigm, which will involve trillions of connected
devices. This workshop will leverages and explores the infrastructure, communication, sensor
technologies, networking technologi Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)es, data/storage/analytics and security aspects of IoT. Participants taking this workshop will be introduced to the fundamentals of the IoT paradigm, including hardware
platforms, communication protocols, and the types of services that are enabled for this ecosystem.

## Learning Outcomes
This workshop will teach you:
+ An understanding of how microprocessors, sensors, and radio hardware are integrated in an embedded
hardware platform.
+ Learn how to make a low footprint battery powered IoT node & communicate between hardware & cloud.
+ Understand the fundamentals of configuring, launching, integrating & maintaining your own IoT solution.
+ Gain knowledge on how interoperability is the key to dealing with the fragmentation of the IoT market.
## Pre-requisites
+ Basic Soldering.
+ C programming language (basic level)
+ Bread boarding (Good to know but not necessary)
## Our Pedagogy
Our proposed workshop is based on experiential learning methodology, which involves a series of highly interactive and intense individual and group based activities. Our relationship with students continues even after the workshop where we offer online and offline technical support to convert their ideas into reality.

## SDIoT P4U Lab
P4U lab is an initiative of SDIoT to inspire Tech-enthusiasts and Entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into new prototypes and products by giving them access to a range of advanced digital manufacturing technology. It began as a common working place of SDIoT members, and became into a collaborative platform of tech-enthusiast from Delhi NCR. You can find more information about P4U Lab on the SDIoT Website.
