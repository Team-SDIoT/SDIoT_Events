# <img src="Iot.png" height="60" width="90">Getting Started with Internet of Things (IoT)
The internet of things offers an unparalleled opportunity to ignite profound business transformation across every
industry. We are moving towards a new computing paradigm, which will involve trillions of connected
devices. This workshop will leverages and explores the infrastructure, communication, sensor
technologies, networking technologi Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)es, data/storage/analytics and security aspects of IoT. Participants
taking this workshop will be introduced to the fundamentals of the IoT paradigm, including hardware
platforms, communication protocols, and the types of services that can be enabled over this ecosystem.

## SDIoT P4U Lab
P4U lab is an initiative of SDIoT to inspire Tech-enthusiasts and Entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into new prototypes and products by giving them access to a range of advanced digital manufacturing technology. It began as a common working place of SDIoT members, and became into a collaborative platform of tech-enthusiast from Delhi NCR. You can find more information about P4U Lab on the SDIoT Website.
