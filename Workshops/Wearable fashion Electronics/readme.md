# Wearable Fashion Electronics

Electronics has become an integral part of our lives. Everything we use today has some form of electronics embedded in it. However, learning about electronics and circuits is usually considered dry, complex and boring. One way to make teaching electronics interesting is by allowing students to design their own gadgets that they can wear and show off. Examples of such gadgets includes the design of a tie that lights up, or an earring that displays changing bright colors. It could be a hair bow designed with bright color LEDs or a bike helmet that can change colors in the night. It may be a jacket with built-in GPS, or a dance costume, or, friendship bracelet that can talk. The possibilities are endless, and it is up to the imagination of students. This workshop will focus on introducing wearable technology using an Arduino compatible wearable microcontroller.

## SDIoT P4U Lab

P4U lab is an initiative of SDIoT to inspire Tech-enthusiasts and Entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into new prototypes and products by giving them access to a range of advanced digital manufacturing technology. It began as a common working place of SDIoT members, and became into a collaborative platform of tech-enthusiast from Delhi NCR. You can find more information about P4U Lab on the SDIoT Website.
