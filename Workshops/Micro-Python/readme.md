# MicroPython <img src="Micropython.jpg" height="10" width="10">
MicroPython includes the standard Python interpreter that runs on small embedded development boards. With MicroPython, you can write Python scripts to control hardware. For example, you can make LEDs blink, communicate with a temperature sensor, control motors and publish a sensor reading on the Internet. It is worth noting that the firmware for such embedded devices is generally coded in Assembly, C or C++, but using MicroPython you can achieve almost the same results as with high level Python.

## SDIoT P4U Lab
P4U lab is an initiative of SDIoT to inspire Tech-enthusiasts and Entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into new prototypes and products by giving them access to a range of advanced digital manufacturing technology. It began as a common working place of SDIoT members, and became into a collaborative platform of tech-enthusiast from Delhi NCR. You can find more information about P4U Lab on the SDIoT Website.
