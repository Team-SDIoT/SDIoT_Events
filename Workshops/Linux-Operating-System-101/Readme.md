# Linux Operating System-101
Linux, which is a free operating system, has been adapted by more computer hardware platforms than any other operating system. It is the most preferred operating system for mobile phones, tablet, computers, network routers and video games, and is used by 95% of the worldâ€™s fastest supercomputers. Moreover operating systems based on the Linux kernel are used in embedded systems such as consumer electronics (i.e. set-top boxes, smart TVs, personal video recorders (PVRs),in-vehicle infotainment (IVI), networking equipment, machine control, industrial automation, navigation equipment, spacecraft flight software, and medical instruments in general, making it the most versatile operating system ever developed. For this reason, it is expected especially Electronics, Information Technology and Computer Engineering students should have knowledge of Linux when they finish their graduation so that they are not left out in the job market.

## SDIoT P4U Lab
P4U lab is an initiative of SDIoT to inspire Tech-enthusiasts and Entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into new prototypes and products by giving them access to a range of advanced digital manufacturing technology. It began as a common working place of SDIoT members, and became into a collaborative platform of tech-enthusiast from Delhi NCR. You can find more information about P4U Lab on the SDIoT Website.
