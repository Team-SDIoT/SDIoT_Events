# Introduction to Computing using BBC:Microbit
The workshop will introduce participants to basis of computing using BBC Micro:bit, a well renowned developed platform designed by BBC, UK for students to make them teach programming. This workshop is great for teaching programming fundamentals, and using drag-and-drop programming paradigm using Microsoft MakeCode open source platform.

## SDIoT P4U Lab
P4U lab is an initiative of SDIoT to inspire Tech-enthusiasts and Entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into new prototypes and products by giving them access to a range of advanced digital manufacturing technology. It began as a common working place of SDIoT members, and became into a collaborative platform of tech-enthusiast from Delhi NCR. You can find more information about P4U Lab on the SDIoT Website.
