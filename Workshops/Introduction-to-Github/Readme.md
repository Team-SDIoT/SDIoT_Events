# Introduction to Github
If you go by the sheer number that GitHub have 20 million user and 52 million projects, this is something every engineering student should try their hand. Either host code, manage projects, or build software what not you could do alongside millions of your fellow peers using the GitHub ecosystem. In total, GitHub is home to open source projects written in 316 unique programming languages. From the code that sent Apollo 11 to the moon, to an open source curriculum that helps nonprofits, you’ll find them all. We’re excited to offer this workshop to you and hope you will use the learning gained from the workshop to expand the GitHub Universe. Finally let's be honest—if you're not hosting your source code on GitHub, your open source project pretty much doesn't exist.

## Why Take This Workshop
Git is used by many tech companies, and a public GitHub profile serves as a great portfolio for any developer. But more than that, you’ll establish an efficient programming workflow that allows you to:
+ Keep track of multiple versions of a file. Track bugs by reverting to previous working versions of a file.
+ The use of tools like Git and GitHub is essential for collaborating with other developers in most professional environments.
## Pre-requirements
+ Basic computer concept.
+ Basic programming concept.
+ This is an all hands on workshop require participant to bring their laptops.
## Our Pedagogy
Our proposed workshop is based on experiential learning methodology, which involves a series of highly interactive and intense individual and group based activities. Our relationship with students continues even after the workshop where we offer online and offline technical support to convert their ideas into reality.
